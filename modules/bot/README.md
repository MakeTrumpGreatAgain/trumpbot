# Hide It Bot

This bot will hide the content of a message by replacing non-blank characters with black blocks, also adding a button underneath the message to reveal the content.

### Possible usages

* Sending a book/series/movie spoiler in a group chat so only those users who choose to see it get potentially spoiled.
* Sending a message to someone in wich the text in the notification will be hidden (useful if you fear someone is looking at their screen and maybe reading their notifications).

### How to use it:

Use it inline starting your message with @hideitBot
